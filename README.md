# Template Engine

# **Project Description**
For this project I modified existing code to create a CLI driven application that prompts a manager to create cards for all relevant team members and display them in a relevant way. Managers can create a team via the required classes the build their team and render it to an HTML file. All classes are required to pass tests to validate them.
